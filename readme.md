## üí° Project Origin
This project is developed by following the comprehensive **"JSP, Servlets and JDBC for Beginners: Build a Database App"** course by **Chad Darby**. It serves as a practical implementation of the concepts taught, focusing on building a robust backend for web applications.

## üìù Project Description
This is a fundamental Java web application designed for tracking student information. Its **primary focus is on demonstrating core backend concepts and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**, rather than complex UI design. The application utilizes **Servlets** for handling controller logic and **JDBC** for robust database interaction (specifically with **PostgreSQL**). Running efficiently on **Apache Tomcat**, the front-end is built using **JavaServer Pages (JSP)**, providing a **functional and straightforward user interface** to facilitate interaction with the core backend functionalities.

## ‚ú® Features
* üìä Displaying a list of students from a PostgreSQL database.
* ‚ûï Adding new students to the database.
* ‚úèÔ∏è Updating existing student information.
* üóëÔ∏è Deleting student records with a confirmation prompt.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
* **Java (JDK 8 or higher recommended)**
* **Apache Tomcat (9.x or higher recommended)**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **Servlets**
* **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**
* **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**
* **Maven** (for project build and dependency management)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running the Application

### Prerequisites
* ‚òï Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
* üê± Apache Tomcat installed and configured.
* üêò PostgreSQL installed and running.

### Database Setup
1.  **Create a PostgreSQL Database:**
    You can create a new database using `psql` or a graphical tool like pgAdmin.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE studenttrackerdb;
    ```
2.  **Create the `student` table:**
    Connect to the `studenttrackerdb` and execute the following SQL to create the table:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE student (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
        last_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL
    );
    ```
3.  **Insert Sample Data (Optional):**
    You can insert some initial data into your table:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO student (first_name, last_name, email) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
    INSERT INTO student (first_name, last_name, email) VALUES ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com');
    ```
